this is very rough, full of bugs and has little or no error handling. it is a proof of concept and i have got it working. it does the following:

- runs a http server listening on the interface and port specified at the bottom of youlibrary.js
the http server has the following api, assuming it is running on 127.0.0.1:8000:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

returns a html document listing the contents of the directory specified at the bottom of youlibrary.js
files in the directory should be .flv - flash video files
each link should open a new browser window which has an embedded flowplayer swf (http://flowplayer.org/) playing the flashvideo you clicked on
the first link in the page is a bookmarklet which can be dragged onto your links bar in your browser. when you are on a video page in youtube you should be able to click this bookmarklet and it will trigger a download on the server

http://127.0.0.1:8000/download/?url=[youtube_url]

where [youtube_url] is the escaped url for the youtube page containing the video you want to download

there are loads of improvements to be made. i ripped off the guts of the server code from the excellent code here:

will post some updates/bug fixes as soon as i can... feel free to clone this and play around with it. git clone url is:

git://github.com/billywhizz/scratch.git

configuration:

just change the IP, Port, download directory and youtube id in yutest.js:

e.g. 

var fuip = "192.168.2.191";
var fuport = 8000;
var fufilesdir = "../vids";
// change to some sort of unique identifier for yourself. google throttles based on this as far as i can tell.
var myurl = "http://www.google.com/";
